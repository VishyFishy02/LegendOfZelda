My experience on the Zelda game project has been positive. I have grown in three key areas:
object-oriented design patterns, the problem-solving process, and resilience and trust in
group/team work.
Going into the course, I knew I wanted to gain more experience with a start-to-finish project
using an Agile development cycle. Object-oriented design patterns were introduced early on in
the course. I was introduced to the importance of elegant solutions and high code quality, which
helped alleviate some of the pain in the later half of the course when we returned to previous
structures and solutions to increment on them. The design patterns that I found to be the most
useful were the state pattern, which made debugging Link's behavior and adding new behavior
relatively easy, and the sprite factory, which cleaned up a lot of our code and made adding new
content to the game predictable and clean. Lastly, the singleton pattern was useful because
much of Link was public and called everywhere within the code. We decided that making Link a
singleton ensured we could only have one instance of him and provided a global point of access
for the game states and collision handling.
The problem-solving process also presented challenges in each sprint. Since this was a
continuously developing project, solutions needed to be maintainable. The Zelda game pushed
me to solve hard problems in clean and maintainable ways, which increased my confidence and
critical-thinking ability. I improved on taking ideas to the whiteboard and working through them.
This was especially useful when devising the collision detection and handling system. I also
grew in thinking like an object-oriented programmer, which contrasted greatly with my previous
experience in the computer science curriculum at OSU.
Resilience and having faith in the team was also an important aspect of the course. I saw just
how capable my CSE classmates are. Paired programming and having groupmates revise
buggy code was extremely helpful. Seeing their thought process and creative solutions to
difficult problems was inspiring and motivated me to do good work as well. My respect and faith
in the group's ability to tackle difficult tasks and be resilient grew with each sprint. Task
delegation was necessary for our group to meet sprint requirements, and we bonded through
working long hours during crunch time in libraries and empty classrooms. We remained positive
and laughed through the pain. I walk away from the project grateful for the opportunity to work
with the team and understanding the importance of having faith that group members can
produce results.

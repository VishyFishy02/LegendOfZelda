# Reflection on Zelda Game Project Experience
Object oriented remake of The Legend of Zelda in C# and .NET + Master Sword Trials
## Key Growth Areas
My experience on the Zelda game project has been positive, with significant development in three key areas:

1. **Object-Oriented Design Patterns**: Early introduction to object-oriented design patterns in the course highlighted the importance of elegant solutions and high code quality. This foundation was crucial for revisiting and improving previous structures. Key patterns I found invaluable included:
   - **State Pattern**: Facilitated debugging and adding new behaviors to Link's character.
   - **Sprite Factory**: Streamlined code and eased the addition of new content.
   - **Singleton Pattern**: Provided a global access point for game states and collision handling, essential for managing the public elements of Link's character.

2. **Problem-Solving Process**: Each sprint presented unique challenges, necessitating maintainable solutions. This aspect of the project bolstered my problem-solving skills, particularly in:
   - Developing sustainable and elegant solutions.
   - Enhancing critical thinking and object-oriented programming mindset, differing from my prior experiences at OSU.

3. **Resilience and Trust in Teamwork**: The project emphasized the importance of resilience and trust within the team. Key insights include:
   - Appreciating the capabilities of my CSE classmates.
   - Benefiting from paired programming and peer reviews.
   - Learning the significance of task delegation and team resilience, especially during intensive periods.

## Personal Development
- **Critical Thinking**: Confronting complex challenges, like the collision detection system, enhanced my critical thinking abilities.
- **Collaboration**: Active collaboration, particularly during whiteboard sessions, was crucial for refining ideas and developing solutions.
- **Respect and Faith in Team**: My respect and faith in the team's abilities grew with each sprint, inspired by their creative problem-solving methods.

## Best Practices in Software Development
Reflecting on the project, I've identified several best practices in software development:

1. **Proactive Project Management**: Defining sprint goals early and documenting them in task tracking software helps in maintaining clarity and reducing delivery risks.

2. **Agile Workflow**: Agile methodologies enable continuous development and frequent stakeholder check-ins, leading to more effective feedback and a higher quality end product. It also provides opportunities for refactoring and reducing technical debt.

3. **High Code Quality**: Writing well-organized, maintainable code enhances team efficiency and makes the development process more enjoyable. It also simplifies debugging and allows the team to focus on creative aspects rather than fixing errors.

## Conclusion
I conclude this project with gratitude for the team experience and a deeper understanding of the importance of trust, resilience in group work, and adherence to best practices in software development. The Zelda game project was not only a journey in coding and design but also in collaboration, problem-solving, and personal growth.

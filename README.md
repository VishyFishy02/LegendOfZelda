# Reflection on the Zelda Game Development Experience
## Key Growth Areas
My experience on the Zelda game project has been positive, with significant development in three key areas:

1. **Object-Oriented Design Patterns**: Early introduction to object-oriented design patterns in the course highlighted the importance of elegant solutions and high code quality. This foundation was crucial for revisiting and improving previous structures. Key patterns I found invaluable included:
   - **State Pattern**: Facilitated debugging and adding new behaviors to Link's character.
   - **Sprite Factory**: Streamlined code and eased the addition of new content.
   - **Singleton Pattern**: Provided a global access point for game states and collision handling, essential for managing the public elements of Link's character.

2. **Problem-Solving Process**: Each sprint necessitated maintainable solutions so as not to overwhelm our technical debt. I felt I grew in my ablility to: 
   - Developing sustainable and elegant solutions.
   - Think in an object-oriented programming mindset, differing from the sorts of procedural problem sets we completed in the software series of courses.

3. **Resilience and Trust in Teamwork**: I felt I grew in my ability to trust the team and delegate tasks. I just want to mention that I: 
   - Appreciate the hard efforts and talents of Lisha, Tuhin, and Brittaney.
   - Benefitted from the paired programming and peer reviews.
   - Will be quicker to delegate tasks, especially during intensive periods.

## Personal Development
- **Critical Thinking**: Confronting complex constraints and challenges in the collision detection system enhanced pulled a lot out of me and enhanced my critical thinking capabilities.
- **Collaboration**: Active collaboration, particularly during whiteboard sessions, was crucial for refining ideas and developing solutions.
- **Respect and Faith in Team**: My respect and faith in the team's abilities grew with each sprint.
